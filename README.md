## Task
Develop a Rest API that will let you manage information for songs. Your API will be able to create, list, update and remove songs. You will only need to create one model to handle the
song data. The expected information are:
- Title
- Artist
- Album
- Genre

You are also expected to generate overall statistics:
- Total number of songs, artists, albums, genres
- Number of songs in every genre
- Number of songs & albums each artist has
- Number of songs in each album â€¦ and so on.

You can add any stat you can think of.
